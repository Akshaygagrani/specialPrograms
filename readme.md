# specialPrograms
## Welcome to this repository!!
* ### Overview
    >This repository is a collection of few of the implementations of the data structures and algorithms that we come accross when we were a beginner in the world of programming. It also contains some advanced algorithms. This repository is open for everyone so anyone can refer to the programs/algorithms while implementing any of them.

* ### Development
    >This repository is currently open to public please feel free to add your interesting programs/algorithms to the repository.
In case of any errors or bugs you encounter in any of the published code, please let the admins of this repository know so we can fix it ASAP

* ### Contribution
   >Please adhere to the contribution format w.r.t. past submissions, don't mix algorithms and their implementations with each other, comment your code properly and most importantly have fun while coding! After all, the more you code, more you learn !
