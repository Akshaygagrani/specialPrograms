# Some Special Programs

This repository is a collection of few of the implementations of the data structures and algorithms that we come accross when we are a beginner in the world of programming. This repository can also contains some advanced algorithm if anyone wants. So that anyone can refer to the programs while implementing any sort of algorithm.

Feel free to add your interesting programs to the repo also. Let the admin know if you find errors or bugs in any codes here. After all, the more code you read, more you learn !
